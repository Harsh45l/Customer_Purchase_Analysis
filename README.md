# Customer Purchase Analysis

This project aims to predict customer purchase behavior using machine learning models. The project uses customer data to analyze purchasing patterns and build predictive models based on customer demographics, income, and purchasing history.

## Project Overview

The customer purchase data is processed and visualized to extract meaningful insights. The machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, are then trained on this data to predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase.

## Features

- **Logistic Regression:** A statistical model to predict customer purchase likelihood.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Standardization of numerical features for model optimization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing customer data to identify patterns in purchase behavior.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
